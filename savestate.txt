Nintendulator Save State Format
 Updated:  January 11, 2006
---------------------------------------

For simplicity, savestates should only be saved during VBLANK; otherwise,
the entire video buffer would have to be saved.

Current implementation only saves states during scanline 240.

All multiple-byte variables are stored LSB-first (little endian).

Data types:
	char[N]  - plain text
	(u)int8  - (un)signed 8 bit variable
	(u)int16 - (un)signed 16 bit variable
	(u)int32 - (un)signed 32 bit variable

-- Filename:
	<ROM Filename, extension stripped>.NS# for savestates
	<ROM Filename, extension stripped>.NMV for movies

-- Main File Header:

	Identification	- <char[4] = "NSS",0x1A>
	Version string	- <char[4] = "0960">
	Filesize	- <uint32 = filesize, not including this header>
	Type		- <char[4] = "NSAV" for normal savestate, "NREC"
			   for movie savestate, "NMOV" for finished movie>

-- Section blocks:

Section block headers are 8 bytes in length.  The first DWORD defines what
section it is, the second DWORD defines the total size of the section (not
including the header).

	<char[4] section> <uint32 size>
